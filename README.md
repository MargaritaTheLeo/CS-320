Protecting program codes is an important task in today's world of information technology. Program codes contain valuable information that can be used by intruders for illegal purposes. Therefore, it is necessary to take measures to protect software codes from unauthorized access and use.

Program code protection methods.

*Authentication and authorization*
Authentication and authorization are methods that control access to software codes and determine which users are authorized to access and perform certain actions. Authentication verifies a user's identity, and authorization determines the user's access rights.

*Encryption of program codes*
Encryption is the process of converting program code into a form that is incomprehensible to outsiders. Encryption can prevent unauthorized access to software code and protect it from being modified or copied. Encryption can be symmetric (uses one key for encryption and decryption) or asymmetric (uses different keys for encryption and decryption).

*Tamper detection and prevention*
Tamper detection and prevention are techniques that detect and prevent unauthorized attempts to access software code. This may include monitoring the system for suspicious activity, using an intrusion detection system (IDS) or intrusion prevention system (IPS), and regularly updating and patching software code to address known vulnerabilities.

*Access and Privilege Restriction*
Access and privilege restriction are techniques that restrict access to program code to only certain users or groups of users. This can include setting different access and privilege levels for different users, as well as using access control mechanisms such as access control lists (ACLs) or role-based access models.

*Regular updates and patching*
Regular updating and patching are methods to fix known vulnerabilities in software code and update it to the latest version. Developers and system administrators should monitor updates and patches released by software code developers and apply them as soon as possible to fix known vulnerabilities and improve the security of software code.

These are just some of the methods used to secure software code. A combination of different methods and technologies can provide better protection of software code from threats and unauthorized access.

The better the development team understands user needs, the more likely it is that the quality of the solution will be higher, the system will be successful, and the team will be more motivated to develop the system further. There are certain practices that help to make the work of identifying and describing user needs better. 

*Document identified needs*
A key practice that is greatly underestimated. Very often the communication of needs to the team is limited to verbal conversations and remains only in the minds of those who participated. This is exacerbated by the fact that each participant may have understood things in his or her own way and communicated the information to other team members in such a distorted way.

*Conduct a deeper analysis of the problem*
This analysis allows you to better understand the problem: how frequent it is, how relevant it is to customers. Takes more time than a top-level checklist, but allows you to identify more details. Also allows you to make descriptions in a more structured way. It can be used both before the top-level checklist and separately from it.

*Write down "lessons learned" so that you don't step on the same mistakes twice*
Write down the problems we encounter in the process of developing new functionality and use them as a checklist. Such a list will be constantly replenished. It is important not to be lazy and write everything down - at the current moment it seems to us that we will never make the same mistake again (it's obvious!), but a few weeks pass and getting bogged down in the hustle and bustle of the project you can step on the same rake a second time. A checklist will keep everything safe and together with the habit of regularly referring to it can save development teams a lot of time and effort. Our list of such "lessons learned" at the moment is about the size of this article, and some of the items have been summarized and added to the top-level checklist.

*Release early, release often*
It is impossible to take everything into account. When the system starts working in a combat environment, unexpected requirements will be revealed, which in turn may require significant system modifications. Therefore, the sooner the next release is released and delivered to the real customer, the sooner we will get new information and adjust the product development vector.

In between releases, you can show the solution image - MVP or at least a mockup - to colleagues from departments that are close to the customer (sales, implementation, technical support, etc.). You can invite them to demo-meetings on sprints or sometimes conduct mini-corridor studies: show them clickable mockups and ask them to tell you how they would execute certain scenarios. When people see an image of the solution, they can better visualize it in a work/business scenario and can more pinpoint where the weaknesses of the solution will be or non-obvious business scenarios and problems can be identified.

When it comes to software development, there are many different aspects that go into the process. The path from planning to implementation is long, making software development complex and demanding, but nevertheless necessary to create successful computer programs. By understanding the different stages of development and what goes into them, you can create programs that meet user needs and function properly.

Software development is the process of designing and coding programs to meet specific requirements. It encompasses all phases of the software development life cycle from analysis, design, and creation to testing, deployment, and maintenance.

It includes:

- Translating user requirements into system specifications.
- Creation of detailed designs.
- Code implementation.
- Conducting rigorous testing.
- Debugging and problem solving.
- Verifying quality assurance standards.
- Making periodic improvements to existing systems.
  
This process also includes researching existing technologies that can be modified or combined to create a new application.

Software life cycle is a series of stages that any software product goes through from the moment of its idea to the moment of its release into wide use. In fact, software development life cycle is the very process of software product design and development.

It is important to note that there are many life cycle models, such as cascade, incremental, and spiral.

Any model regulates only the realization of life cycle stages, but not the life cycle itself, which in principle remains unchanged. So, software life cycle is 6 main stages that any software development goes through:

- Gathering and analyzing requirements for the software product.

- Developing documentation for all the requirements for the product.

- Development of product design.

- Developing the software product.

- Passing various tests.

- Commissioning and support of the software.
